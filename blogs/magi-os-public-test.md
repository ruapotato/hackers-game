# MAGI OS | Public Test

MAGI (Machine Augmented GTK Interface) is a local open-source AI powered operating system.

## Current Features

### Built-in LLM with Context Awareness
The system includes a local large language model that understands the context of what you're working on, providing relevant assistance without sending data to external servers.

### Voice Transcription Anywhere
Voice transcription functionality that can be used anywhere in the system - dictate text, give commands, or interact with the AI assistant using your voice.

### E-Reader with Text-to-Speech
A built-in e-reader that can read anything you select or highlight aloud, making content accessible in audio form.

## The Vision

The goal is to continue integration so that this can be used as a full AI agent OS. MAGI represents an approach to desktop computing where AI assistance is deeply integrated into the user interface, making it more intuitive and powerful for everyday tasks.

### Key Principles
- **Local Processing**: Your data stays on your machine
- **Open Source**: Full transparency and community contribution
- **Deep Integration**: AI isn't just an app, it's part of the OS
- **GTK-Based**: Native Linux desktop experience
