# MAGI OS | Public Test

MAGI (Machine Augmented GTK Interface) is a local open-source AI powered operating system. For now, there's a built-in LLM with context awareness, voice transcription you can use anywhere, and an e-reader built-in that can read anything you select or highlight.

The goal is to continue integration so that this can be used as a full AI agent OS. MAGI represents an approach to desktop computing where AI assistance is deeply integrated into the user interface, making it more intuitive and powerful for everyday tasks.
