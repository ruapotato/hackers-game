# librem5 Interface overview

Playing with the latest snapshot from the Librem5 dev VM.

This video provides an overview of the Librem 5 phone interface, exploring the user experience and design of Purism's Linux-based smartphone. The Librem 5 runs a fully open-source mobile operating system, demonstrating what a privacy-focused, Linux-powered mobile device looks like in practice.

## The Phosh Shell

Phosh (Phone Shell) is the default graphical shell for the Librem 5. It's built on top of GNOME technologies and designed specifically for mobile use:

- **Touch-optimized UI**: Large touch targets and gesture-based navigation
- **Adaptive design**: Applications can adapt between phone and desktop modes
- **GTK-based**: Uses standard GTK widgets with libhandy for mobile adaptations

## Interface Components

- **App drawer**: Access to installed applications
- **Top panel**: System indicators, time, and notifications
- **Bottom gestures**: Swipe up to access the app drawer or switch apps
- **Lock screen**: Secure PIN entry with large touch-friendly buttons

## Development Environment

The Librem 5 dev VM allows developers to test and develop applications before hardware availability. This virtual machine environment mirrors the phone's software stack, enabling:

- Application testing
- UI/UX experimentation
- Driver and system software development

## Comparison with Traditional Mobile OS

Unlike Android's custom Java/Kotlin runtime or iOS's proprietary frameworks, the Librem 5 uses standard Linux desktop technologies adapted for mobile. This means developers familiar with GNOME/GTK development can easily create applications for the phone.
