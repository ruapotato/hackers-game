# Alternative Librem GUI | KDE Plasma Mobile

A quick look at Plasma Mobile as an alternative graphical interface for the Librem phone.

KDE Plasma Mobile offers a different user experience compared to the default Phosh interface on the Librem 5. This video explores running Plasma Mobile on the Librem 5 dev kit, showcasing the Qt-based mobile shell as an alternative to the GTK-based Phosh.

## Plasma Mobile Overview

Plasma Mobile is KDE's take on a mobile-friendly Linux interface, featuring:

- Qt/QML-based UI components
- Familiar KDE design language
- Different app ecosystem compared to Phosh
- Alternative user experience paradigm

## Why Alternative GUIs Matter

Having multiple GUI options for Linux phones is important for user choice and ecosystem diversity. While Phosh (developed by Purism) is the default on the Librem 5, Plasma Mobile demonstrates that users have options for customizing their mobile Linux experience.

The Librem 5's hardware and PureOS base make it flexible enough to run different mobile shells, giving users the freedom to choose the interface that works best for them.
