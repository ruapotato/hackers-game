# Librem5 VS Sailfish OS

A comparison between the Librem5 and Sailfish OS, exploring the differences between these two mobile Linux approaches.

## Platform Philosophy

### Librem 5 / PureOS
- **Fully open source**: All software components are free/libre
- **GNOME-based**: Uses Phosh shell and GTK applications
- **Mainline Linux kernel**: No Android dependencies
- **Hardware designed for Linux**: Purpose-built device

### Sailfish OS
- **Partially open source**: UI layer is proprietary
- **Qt-based**: Uses Silica UI and Qt/QML applications
- **Android app compatibility**: Uses libhybris for Android driver support
- **Runs on Android hardware**: Ported to existing phones

## Technical Approach

### Librem 5
- Uses upstream Linux drivers
- No Android compatibility layer required
- Full GNU/Linux userspace
- Direct hardware access

### Sailfish OS
- Uses libhybris to bridge Android drivers
- Includes Android compatibility layer
- Mer core Linux distribution
- Works with Android device drivers

## Application Ecosystem

### Librem 5
- Standard Linux desktop applications (adapted for mobile)
- GTK/GNOME applications with libhandy
- Potential for Flatpak support
- Any Debian-packaged software

### Sailfish OS
- Native Sailfish applications (Qt/QML)
- Android application support
- Jolla store for native apps
- Community ports and apps

## Privacy and Freedom

### Librem 5
- Hardware kill switches for radios and cameras
- No proprietary blobs in main system
- Completely auditable software stack
- Strong focus on user privacy

### Sailfish OS
- Open source core, proprietary UI
- Runs on hardware with binary blobs
- Android compatibility requires proprietary components
- Privacy through obscurity (not on Google/Apple platform)

## Community and Development

Both platforms have active communities contributing to their development, but with different focuses:
- Librem 5: Hardware and full-stack open source development
- Sailfish OS: App development and device porting
