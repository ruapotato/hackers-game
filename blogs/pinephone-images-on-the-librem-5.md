# Pinephone Images on the Librem 5

Let's hack around with some Linux phone images.

## The Project

In this video, I explore running various PinePhone operating system images on the Librem 5 hardware. This involves building custom images and adapting them to work on different Linux phone platforms, demonstrating the flexibility of open-source mobile Linux ecosystems.

## Why Cross-Platform Images?

The Linux phone ecosystem has multiple hardware options:
- **Librem 5** - Purism's privacy-focused phone
- **PinePhone** - Pine64's community phone

Having software that works across devices:
- Expands user choice
- Reduces fragmentation
- Allows trying different distros on your hardware
- Demonstrates open-source flexibility

## Operating Systems Explored

### Arch Linux ARM
The Arch experience on mobile - rolling release, bleeding edge packages, AUR access.

### OpenSUSE
Bringing the green chameleon to mobile Linux with Tumbleweed or Leap options.

### Mobian
Debian-based mobile Linux with strong community support.

## Technical Approach

The project involves:
1. Obtaining PinePhone OS images
2. Adapting device-specific configurations
3. Building images compatible with Librem 5 hardware
4. Testing and debugging the adaptations

## Build Script

The build script for creating these images is available for those who want to experiment with their own Linux phone setups:
