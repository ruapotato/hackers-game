# Pinephone Images on the Librem 5

Let's hack around with some Linux phone images.

In this video, I explore running various Pinephone operating system images on the Librem 5 hardware. This involves building custom images and adapting them to work on different Linux phone platforms, demonstrating the flexibility of open-source mobile Linux ecosystems.

The build script for creating these images is available for those who want to experiment with their own Linux phone setups.
