# Librem 5 | News and OpenSuSE

Let's chat about the Librem 5 and the latest news surrounding this Linux phone.

## OpenSuSE Port

One of the exciting developments is the community effort to port OpenSuSE to the Librem 5. Since the Librem 5 is built on open standards and uses mainline Linux kernel support, alternative distributions can be adapted for the device.

### What This Means

- **Distribution choice**: Users aren't locked into PureOS
- **Package ecosystem**: Access to OpenSuSE's extensive repositories
- **YaST integration**: OpenSuSE's configuration tools adapted for mobile
- **Community support**: Broader developer community involvement

## The Power of Open Hardware

The Librem 5's open hardware design enables these kinds of ports. Unlike Android phones that require significant reverse engineering, the Librem 5's specifications and drivers are available for anyone to use.

## Gaming and Applications

The video also covers games and applications being tested on the dev kit. The ability to run standard Linux applications opens up a vast ecosystem of software.

## Latest News

Updates on:
- Hardware development progress

## Why Alternative Distros Matter

Having multiple Linux distributions available for the Librem 5 ensures:
- Long-term software support even if Purism changes direction
