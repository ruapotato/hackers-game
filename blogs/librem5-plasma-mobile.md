# Librem5 | Plasma Mobile

Testing the new version of Plasma Mobile and a few games.

In this video, we explore running Plasma Mobile on the Librem 5 Linux phone. Plasma Mobile is KDE's mobile-optimized interface, offering a full Linux desktop experience adapted for touchscreens and smaller displays.

We test out the latest version of Plasma Mobile and see how well it performs on the Librem 5 hardware. Additionally, we try out a few games to see what the gaming experience is like on this Linux phone setup.
