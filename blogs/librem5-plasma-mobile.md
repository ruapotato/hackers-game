# Librem5 | Plasma Mobile

Testing the new version of Plasma Mobile and a few games.

In this video, we explore running Plasma Mobile on the Librem 5 Linux phone. Plasma Mobile is KDE's mobile-optimized interface, offering a full Linux desktop experience adapted for touchscreens and smaller displays.

## Plasma Mobile vs Phosh

The Librem 5 ships with Phosh (GNOME-based) by default, but Plasma Mobile provides an alternative desktop environment. Key differences:

### Plasma Mobile
- Based on KDE Plasma desktop
- Qt/QML application framework
- KDE application ecosystem
- Different visual style and interaction patterns

### Phosh
- Based on GNOME technologies
- GTK application framework
- GNOME application ecosystem
- Default on Librem 5

## Gaming Tests

The video includes testing several open-source games on Plasma Mobile:

### Teeworlds
- 2D multiplayer shooter
- Runs well on the Librem 5 hardware
- Touch controls require adaptation

### SuperTuxKart
- 3D kart racing game
- More demanding on the hardware
- Playable with some performance tweaks

### Minetest
- Open-source voxel game (Minecraft-like)
- Touch controls for building and exploration
- Performance varies based on world complexity

## Why Desktop Environment Choice Matters

Having multiple desktop environment options means:
- User preference respected
- Different application ecosystems available
- Varied approaches to mobile UX
- True platform freedom
