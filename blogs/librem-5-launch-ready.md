# Is the Librem 5 Ready for Launch?

Progress on the dev kit has been absolutely crazy at the moment. September 15th was the last time I had to flash the dev kit - just nine days before the initial launch of the Librem 5.

## After Flashing

After flashing, it was clear that this version was not ready for the public. For example, on the lockscreen when you enter your PIN code, the key presses remain highlighted - a bit of a security fail.

We can also see the unfinished app lineup including GNOME Tweaks, Vim, and non-final icons.

## Browser Performance

If you recall in my last video, the web browser performance is basically unusable in certain situations. Heavy JavaScript sites bring the device to its knees.

## The Verdict

Is it ready? Not quite for daily driver use, but the progress is undeniable. The foundation is solid, and things are improving rapidly.
