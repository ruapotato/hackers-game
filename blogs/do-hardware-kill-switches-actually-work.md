# Do Hardware Kill Switches Actually Work?

Linux phones are shipping with hardware kill switches. But do they actually work? I tested all three on the FLX1s at the hardware level.

Spoiler: The mic switch is a true analog disconnect - no software can bypass it.

But do I actually use them? ...What's your use case?
