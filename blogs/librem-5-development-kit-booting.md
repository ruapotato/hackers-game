# Librem 5 Development Kit [Booting]

A look at the Librem 5 development kit booting up.

This video shows the early stages of Purism's Linux phone development, demonstrating the boot process of the dev kit hardware that preceded the final Librem 5 device.

## Boot Process Overview

The video captures the complete boot sequence of the Librem 5 development kit:

- Power-on and bootloader initialization
- Kernel loading
- System initialization
- Desktop environment startup

## Development Kit Hardware

The Librem 5 dev kit featured:

- i.MX 8M processor (same as production Librem 5)
- Development board form factor
- Full I/O access for testing
- Modular design for component testing

## Why This Matters

The development kit allowed developers and enthusiasts to:

- Start working on mobile Linux applications before the phone's official release
- Test and debug hardware drivers
- Develop the Phosh mobile shell
- Optimize the software stack for the i.MX 8M platform

## Early Development Insights

This boot video shows the state of the software stack early in development:

- Boot time performance
- Initial desktop environment state
- System stability during startup

The dev kit was instrumental in getting the Librem 5 ready for production shipments.
