# initrd ramdisk 101

Let's talk about the initrd (initial ramdisk). This video explains what the initrd is and how it fits into the Linux boot process.

The initrd is a temporary root filesystem that gets loaded into memory during the boot process. It contains essential drivers and scripts needed to mount the real root filesystem and continue the boot process. Understanding the initrd is fundamental to understanding how Linux systems boot and troubleshooting boot issues.
