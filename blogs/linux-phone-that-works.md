# Linux Phone That Actually Works - FLX1s Review

Today we're looking at the FLX1S by Fury Labs. It's one of those rare Linux devices that's actually good at being a phone. Let's take a look.

## What's in the Box

- The phone itself
- Some cute stickers
- Glass screen protector (I ordered separately)
- A case
- Free pair of USB-C headphones (nice surprise since there's no headphone jack)

## First Impressions

Quick note on the screen protector - it's glass. Mine cracked in shipping. I'd love to see a film screen protector option instead.

Let me save you some confusion: On day one, I thought the side button was the power button, and the others were programmable. Turns out there are hardware kill switches on this thing!

## The Good

- Actually works as a phone
- Hardware kill switches for privacy
- Real Linux - not Android
- Good build quality

## The Reality

This is one of those rare Linux devices that bridges the gap between "Linux phone enthusiast" and "I just need a phone that works."
