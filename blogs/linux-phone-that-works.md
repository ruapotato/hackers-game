# Linux Phone That Actually Works - FLX1s Review

The FuriLabs FLX1s is a Linux phone that just works. Calls, texts, mobile data - out of the box. But here's the thing: you can keep it simple, or you can go deep. Build apps on device. SSH from anywhere. Run a full Linux desktop in your pocket.

## What's Covered in This Review

- Unboxing and first impressions
- Hardware and buttons
- Phone calls, SMS, and MMS
- GPS and navigation
- Camera reality check
- App situation (Linux + Android layer)
- Daily driver verdict
- Developer perspective

## What's in the Box

- The phone itself
- Some cute stickers
- Glass screen protector (ordered separately)
- A case
- Free pair of USB-C headphones (nice surprise since there's no headphone jack)

## First Impressions

Quick note on the screen protector - it's glass. Mine cracked in shipping. I'd love to see a film screen protector option instead.

Let me save you some confusion: On day one, I thought the side button was the power button, and the others were programmable. Turns out there are hardware kill switches on this thing!

## The Good

- Actually works as a phone
- Hardware kill switches for privacy
- Real Linux - not Android
- Good build quality
- Calls, texts, and mobile data work out of the box

## The Reality

This is one of those rare Linux devices that bridges the gap between "Linux phone enthusiast" and "I just need a phone that works."

## Sneak Peek: Flick Shell

Plus a sneak peek at Flick, a mobile Linux shell currently in development for mobile Linux interfaces.
