# DeepDream Fractal Zoom

This video was generated using a neural network trained for many hours, combining Google's DeepDream technology with fractal zoom imagery.

## How It Was Made

The input for the neural network was the first 1500 255x255 snapshots at 1 second intervals from a fractal zoom video by "Maths Town":

The video was generated via a few tweaks to Google's DeepDream project:

## About DeepDream

DeepDream is a computer vision program created by Google that uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images. The algorithm amplifies the patterns it detects, creating surreal, dream-like imagery.

## Technical Details

- **Training time**: Many hours of neural network training
- **Input resolution**: 255x255 pixel snapshots
- **Frame count**: 1500 frames
- **Source material**: Fractal zoom animation

The combination of mathematical fractals with neural network pattern recognition creates a unique visual experience that blends mathematical precision with AI-generated psychedelic imagery.

More details on the technical implementation are planned for future content.
