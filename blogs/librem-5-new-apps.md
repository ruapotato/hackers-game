# Librem 5 | New Apps

Let's go over localvoice and other new apps for the Librem 5.

This video showcases applications being developed for Purism's Linux phone, including the localvoice project for local voice recognition.

## LocalVoice

LocalVoice is a voice-to-text application designed for the Librem 5 that processes speech recognition locally on the device, ensuring privacy by not sending audio data to external servers.

**Source Code**: https://bitbucket.org/hackersgame/localvoice/src/master/

### Features

- **Local processing**: All voice recognition happens on-device
- **Privacy-focused**: No data sent to cloud services
- **GTK interface**: Native integration with Phosh shell
- **Offline capable**: Works without internet connection

## App Development on Librem 5

The Librem 5 runs a full Linux desktop environment adapted for mobile use. This means:

- Standard GTK/GNOME applications can be adapted for mobile
- Python, C, Rust, and other languages are fully supported
- libhandy provides adaptive widgets for responsive designs
- No proprietary SDKs or app store gatekeeping

## Anbox Integration

Work continues on Anbox support, which would allow running Android applications in a container on the Librem 5. This could expand the available app ecosystem significantly while maintaining the phone's privacy and security model.

## The App Ecosystem

The Librem 5 benefits from the entire Linux application ecosystem. While many desktop apps need UI adaptation for mobile use, the underlying functionality is already present. Developers are actively working on:

- Mobile-optimized versions of popular Linux apps
- New apps designed specifically for the phone
- Ports of open-source mobile apps from other platforms
