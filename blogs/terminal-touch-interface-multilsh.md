# Terminal Touch Interface | Multilsh

This video demonstrates Multilsh, a touch-friendly terminal interface for Linux.

Multilsh provides an alternative way to interact with the command line using touch gestures, making terminal usage more accessible on touchscreen devices and tablets running Linux - particularly useful for Linux phones like the Librem 5.

## The Problem

Traditional terminal interfaces are designed for keyboards and mice. On touch devices like Linux phones, typing commands can be cumbersome with on-screen keyboards, and navigating command history or completing commands requires awkward taps.

## The Solution: Multilsh

Multilsh reimagines the terminal interface for touch:

- **Touch-optimized controls** - Large, tap-friendly buttons and gestures
- **Terminal keyboard integration** - Designed to work well with on-screen keyboards
- **Full terminal functionality** - All the power of a standard shell

## Source Code

The project is open source and available for you to use and contribute to:

**Repository:** [Multilsh on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/hackersgame/multilsh/src/master/)

## Why This Matters

As Linux phones become more viable for daily use, we need interfaces that work well with touch input. Multilsh is one approach to making the command line accessible to Linux phone users without sacrificing the power that terminal users expect.
