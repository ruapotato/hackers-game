# New Linux Phone DE | Flick V0

Playing around building a new DE for mobile Linux.

## What is Flick?

Flick is a new desktop environment designed specifically for mobile Linux devices. This is version 0 - an early development release showing the initial concepts and functionality.

## Why Another Mobile DE?

Current options for mobile Linux desktop environments include:
- **Phosh** - GNOME-based, widely used
- **Plasma Mobile** - KDE's mobile interface
- **Sxmo** - Minimalist, tiling approach

Flick explores different design ideas and interaction patterns for touch-based Linux interfaces.

## Design Goals

- **Touch-First**: Designed for finger input from the ground up
- **Intuitive Gestures**: Natural swipe and tap interactions
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage for phone hardware
- **Open Source**: FOSS from day one

## Current Features (V0)

As an early version, Flick demonstrates:
- Basic mobile UI framework
- Touch gesture handling
- App launching interface
- Initial integration with Linux phone hardware

## Development Status

This is very much a work in progress - a tech demo and proof of concept. The goal is to explore what a fresh take on mobile Linux UI could look like.
