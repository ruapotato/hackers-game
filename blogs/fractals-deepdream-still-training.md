# fractals + deepdream.. Still training

This project combines fractal imagery with Google's DeepDream neural network. The input consists of the first 1500 snapshots (255x255 resolution) taken at 1 second intervals from a fractal video by "Maths Town".

The result is a mesmerizing visualization that demonstrates what happens when you feed mathematical fractal patterns through a neural network trained on image recognition.
