# fractals + deepdream.. Still training

This project combines fractal imagery with Google's DeepDream neural network, creating a mesmerizing visualization that demonstrates what happens when you feed mathematical fractal patterns through a neural network trained on image recognition.

## Input Data

The input consists of the first 1500 snapshots taken from a fractal video by "Maths Town":
- Resolution: 255x255 pixels per frame
- Sampling rate: 1 second intervals
- Source video: [Maths Town Fractals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCpLWbHVNhk)

## DeepDream Processing

The neural network was still in training during the creation of this video. DeepDream works by using a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images, creating the characteristic dream-like, psychedelic visuals.
