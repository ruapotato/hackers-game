# Librem 5 Development Kit [Onboard Screen]

The screen story.

This video documents the experience of working with the onboard screen on the Librem 5 development kit, including challenges encountered and solutions found.

## Corrections

Important corrections to information in the video:

- **0:20**: It was a hardware issue, but with a software workaround available
- **2:08**: The ribbon cable mentioned was for the touch controller, not the display. The display's FPC (Flexible Printed Circuit) is also unplugged in that shot.

## Display Challenges

Working with development hardware often involves troubleshooting display issues:

- Ribbon cable connections for the display panel
- Touch controller cable connections (separate from display)
- FPC (Flexible Printed Circuit) handling
- Hardware vs software issues

## Development Kit Display Setup

The dev kit display system consists of:

- Main display panel with its own FPC connection
- Separate touch controller with its own ribbon cable
- Driver software for both components

## Lessons Learned

This video highlights the complexities of developing mobile hardware:

- Multiple cable connections that must be properly seated
- Distinction between display output and touch input systems
- The iterative nature of hardware debugging
- How software workarounds can sometimes address hardware issues

Understanding these hardware details helps developers and enthusiasts work more effectively with development hardware.
