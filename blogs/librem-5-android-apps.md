# Librem 5 | Android apps?

Will the Librem 5 be able to run android applications?

This video explores the possibility of running Android applications on the Librem 5 Linux phone and what that might mean for app compatibility and the overall user experience.

## The App Gap Challenge

One of the biggest challenges facing Linux phones is the lack of native applications compared to Android and iOS. This video discusses potential solutions for running Android apps on the Librem 5.

## Possible Solutions

### Anbox
Android in a Box (Anbox) is a compatibility layer that allows running Android applications on Linux systems. It uses container technology to run a full Android system.

### Waydroid
Another solution that came after this video is Waydroid, which provides better performance and compatibility for running Android apps on Linux phones.

## Considerations

- **Performance**: Running Android apps through a compatibility layer adds overhead
- **Privacy**: Purism's focus on privacy may conflict with some Android app behaviors
- **Native Apps**: The long-term goal is to have native Linux apps, but compatibility layers help bridge the gap

## The Importance of App Support

For a Linux phone to be viable as a daily driver, users need access to essential applications. Android app compatibility could help the Librem 5 reach a wider audience while the native Linux mobile app ecosystem grows.
