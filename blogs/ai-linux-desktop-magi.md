# AI Linux Desktop | MAGI

Introducing MAGI, an AI-powered Linux desktop environment that integrates large language model capabilities directly into your computing experience.

MAGI represents a new approach to desktop computing, where AI assistance is built into the core desktop experience rather than being a separate application. This enables intelligent workflows and smart desktop interactions that understand context and user intent.

## Key Features

- AI-assisted desktop workflows
- Natural language interaction with your system
- Integration with multiple LLM backends (OpenAI, Mistral, Claude, Llama, and more)
- Intelligent file and application management

## Resources

- **Source code**: https://github.com/ruapotato/MAGI
- **Project page**: https://www.hackers-game.com/magi/

MAGI showcases how large language models can transform the traditional desktop paradigm, making computing more intuitive and accessible through natural language interaction.
