# Neural Network Meets Falling Sand Game

Hey everyone! Today, I'm excited to share my progress on a falling sand game powered by neural networks. Let's dive into the evolution of this project and the fascinating challenges I've encountered along the way.

## The Concept

This project combines the classic falling sand game mechanics with the power of neural networks. Instead of using traditional rule-based physics, the game uses trained neural networks to determine how particles interact with each other and their environment.

## How It Works

### Traditional Falling Sand
In a classic falling sand game:
- Particles follow predefined rules
- Sand falls down, water flows, fire rises
- Each element type has hardcoded behavior

### Neural Network Approach
In this version:
- A neural network learns particle behavior from examples
- The network predicts how particles should move
- Emergent behaviors can arise from training
- The physics can be more organic and surprising

## Technical Implementation

- **Engine**: Pygame for rendering and interaction
- **Neural Network**: Trained to predict particle movements
- **Training Data**: Generated from observed particle interactions

## Challenges Encountered

Creating a neural network-based physics system presents unique challenges:
- Training the network to handle edge cases
- Balancing performance with accuracy
- Getting emergent behavior that's still playable

## Source Code
