# Neural Network Meets Falling Sand Game

Hey everyone! Today, I'm excited to share my progress on a falling sand game powered by neural networks. Let's dive into the evolution of this project and the fascinating challenges I've encountered along the way.

This project combines the classic falling sand game mechanics with the power of neural networks. Instead of using traditional rule-based physics, the game uses trained neural networks to determine how particles interact with each other and their environment.

The source code is available on GitHub for those interested in exploring AI-powered game development.
