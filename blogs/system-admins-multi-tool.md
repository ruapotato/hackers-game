# The System Admin's Multi-tool

Control or install just about any Linux OS, from one device.

This video demonstrates a versatile hardware tool that system administrators can use to manage and install various Linux distributions. Whether you need to deploy a new server, troubleshoot an existing system, or maintain multiple machines, this multi-tool approach streamlines the process by consolidating everything into a single device.

## What It Does

The system admin's multi-tool combines several capabilities:

- **KVM (Keyboard, Video, Mouse) functionality** - Control remote systems as if you were sitting in front of them
- **USB boot capability** - Boot any system from your device with multiple Linux distributions ready to go
- **Keyboard emulation** - Send keystrokes to target systems for automation and setup

## Technical Details

The project involves:

- **Python scripting** - Custom code to manage the multi-tool functionality
- **USB device emulation** - Making the device appear as different USB peripherals
- **Multiple Linux distributions** - Having various distros ready to deploy

## Use Cases

- **Server deployment** - Quickly install Linux on new servers
- **System recovery** - Boot into a live environment to rescue broken systems
- **Remote administration** - Manage systems without needing physical keyboard/monitor switches
- **Consistent tooling** - Carry your entire toolkit in one portable device
