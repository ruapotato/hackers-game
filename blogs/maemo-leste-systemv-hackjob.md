# Maemo Leste SystemV Hackjob #music

Documenting my work for the day in a fun way.

This project takes Bookworm as a foundation with Maemo Leste as inspiration. The repos were forked and modified to replace init with SystemD.

It's a hack, it's a splice - not pretty but it's nice.

The Franken-system boots with TTY login. Running startx as root launches the Hildon desktop. A dummy package for libedev was created as a dirty hack. The UI may look rough, but at least it doesn't crash.

It's a mess but it works - Debian base with Hildon UI!
