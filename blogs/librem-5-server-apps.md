# Librem 5 | Server apps

Running server applications on the Librem 5.

In this video, we explore the unique capability of the Librem 5 to run server applications. Unlike traditional smartphones, the Librem 5's true Linux operating system allows you to host and run server software directly on your phone, demonstrating the versatility of this open-source mobile device.

## Why Server Apps on a Phone?

The Librem 5 runs a standard Linux distribution, which means:

- Any server software packaged for Debian/PureOS can be installed
- Standard networking tools (iptables, SSH, etc.) are available
- The phone can function as a portable server or development environment

## Potential Use Cases

### Media Streaming
- Host a personal media server
- Stream content to other devices on your network
- Netflix and other streaming services through web interfaces

### Development
- Run a local development server
- Test web applications on-the-go
- SSH server for remote access to your phone

### Self-Hosting
- Personal file sync server
- Chat server (Matrix, XMPP)
- VPN endpoint

### Network Tools
- Portable network diagnostics
- WiFi analysis tools
- Network monitoring

## Server Software Options

Examples of server software that can run on the Librem 5:
- **nginx/Apache**: Web servers
- **MariaDB/PostgreSQL**: Databases
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for web apps
- **Python Flask/Django**: Web frameworks
- **SSH server**: Remote access

## Hardware Considerations

While the Librem 5 can run server applications, keep in mind:
- Battery life will be impacted by continuous server operation
- Processing power is limited compared to dedicated servers
- Best for personal/small-scale use cases

## The Power of Real Linux

This capability demonstrates the fundamental difference between the Librem 5 and traditional smartphones. With a real Linux system, your phone becomes a general-purpose computer in your pocket.
