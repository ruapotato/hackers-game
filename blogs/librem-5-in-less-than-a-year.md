# Librem 5 | In Less Than a Year

You should know what Purism is up to.

This video covers the progress Purism has made on the Librem 5 Linux phone. In less than a year, significant developments have been achieved in bringing a truly open-source, privacy-focused smartphone to market.

## Development Progress

The Librem 5 represents a different approach to mobile computing - one that prioritizes user freedom, privacy, and security over the typical smartphone paradigm. The dev kit has seen rapid software improvements, with regular updates bringing new features and better stability.

## Key Developments

- **Hardware Kill Switches**: Physical switches for WiFi/Bluetooth, cellular modem, and camera/microphone
- **PureOS**: A fully free/libre operating system based on Debian
- **Phosh Shell**: A mobile-optimized GNOME-based shell
- **Anbox Integration**: Work on Android app compatibility through Anbox containerization

## The Vision

Purism's goal is to create a phone that respects user privacy and freedom. Unlike Android and iOS, the Librem 5 runs a standard Linux distribution, giving users full control over their device.

## What This Means for Users

- Full root access to your phone
- No vendor lock-in
- Ability to install any Linux software
- Hardware-level privacy controls
- Long-term software support without planned obsolescence
