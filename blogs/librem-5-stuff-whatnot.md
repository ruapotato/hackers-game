# Librem 5 | Stuff and Whatnot

This is what the early version of the launcher/app drawer looked like. It only loaded the primary apps and left all other .desktop files on display.

## The New Launcher

What this meant was if you installed something new, the desktop launcher would be missing. After flashing the new DFK image, this is all changed now.

The launcher displays all installed desktop files, so for the first time we can see what is pre-installed on the dev kit. And I must say, some of this stuff was not expected!

## Pre-installed Apps

The first thing I thought a little odd was there were a few redundant applications. We now have two terminal apps - King's Cross and another one.

## Progress Report

Every flash brings new improvements. The dev kit is really starting to feel like a proper phone platform.
