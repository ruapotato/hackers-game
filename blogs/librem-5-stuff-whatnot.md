# Librem 5 | Stuff and Whatnot

Check out the latest software running on the Librem 5 dev kit.

This is what the early version of the launcher/app drawer looked like. It only loaded the primary apps and left all other .desktop files on display.

## The New Launcher

What this meant was if you installed something new, the desktop launcher would be missing. After flashing the new DFK image, this is all changed now.

The launcher displays all installed desktop files, so for the first time we can see what is pre-installed on the dev kit. And I must say, some of this stuff was not expected!

## Pre-installed Apps

The first thing I thought a little odd was there were a few redundant applications. We now have two terminal apps - King's Cross and another one.

### Notable Pre-installed Software

- **Terminal Emulators**: Multiple options for command-line access
- **File Manager**: GNOME Files for file management
- **Text Editors**: Various options for editing
- **Settings**: System configuration
- **Web Browser**: GNOME Web (Epiphany)
- **Development Tools**: Pre-installed for developers

## The App Drawer Evolution

The app drawer has evolved significantly:

1. **Early version**: Only showed primary apps
2. **Mid development**: Showed .desktop files but with issues
3. **Current version**: Full app listing with proper icons

## Progress Report

Every flash brings new improvements. The dev kit is really starting to feel like a proper phone platform. Key improvements include:

- Better app discovery
- Improved launcher performance
- More polished icons and UI elements
- Reduced boot time

## What This Means for Users

The maturing app launcher means:
- Easier app discovery
- Better organization
- Consistent user experience
- Foundation for future app store integration
