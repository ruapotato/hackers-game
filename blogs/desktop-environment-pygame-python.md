# I Wrote a Desktop Environment in Pygame/Python

I'm open-sourcing my Desktop Environment. It's still in pre-alpha but I figured I should release it before Wayland completely deprecates X11.

Lavinder is running 'janit' as its menu/process handler. janit is also being open-sourced and is useful in plain X11 (with a WM running). I also plan to use janit with Wayland's Weston compositor.
