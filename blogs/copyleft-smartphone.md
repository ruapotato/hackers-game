# Copyleft Smartphone

Android is less free than we were led to believe.

This video explores the reality of Android's open-source claims and examines the copyleft movement in the smartphone space. We discuss the limitations of Android's openness and what alternatives exist for those seeking truly free software on their mobile devices.

## The Problem with "Open Source" Android

While Android is technically open source, in practice:

- Most useful features require proprietary Google services
- Manufacturers add proprietary layers and bloatware
- True freedom to modify and control your device is limited
- Privacy concerns with closed-source components

## The Copyleft Alternative

Copyleft smartphones like the Librem 5 offer a different approach:

- Fully free software stack
- Hardware designed for user freedom
- No reliance on proprietary services
- True ownership and control
