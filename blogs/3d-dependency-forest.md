# 3D Dependency Forest

A 3D visualization tool for exploring dependency trees and understanding complex software relationships.

This project creates a three-dimensional forest visualization of software dependencies, making it easier to understand and navigate complex dependency relationships in a visual and intuitive way. Instead of staring at flat lists of dependencies, you can explore them as a navigable 3D environment where the structure and relationships become immediately apparent.

- **Source code**: https://bitbucket.org/hackersgame/3d-dependency-tree/src/master/

The visualization helps developers quickly identify dependency chains, spot potential issues with deeply nested dependencies, and understand the overall architecture of a project's dependency tree.
