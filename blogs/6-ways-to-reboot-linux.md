# 6 ways to reboot Linux

Explore six different methods to reboot a Linux system. Whether you're a beginner or experienced user, knowing multiple ways to restart your system can be useful in different situations - especially when the system becomes unresponsive.

## Reboot Methods Covered

The video covers various approaches including:

- **reboot** - The standard reboot command
- **shutdown** - Using shutdown with reboot flags
- **poweroff/halt** - Related power management commands
- **Magic SysRq keys** - Emergency keyboard shortcuts for when the system is frozen
- **Force reboot** - Methods for forcing a restart when normal commands fail

## When to Use Different Methods

Understanding these different approaches is crucial for system administration:

- Normal operations: Use `reboot` or `shutdown -r`
- Frozen system: Magic SysRq key combinations (REISUB sequence)
- Emergency situations: Force reboot options

The Magic SysRq keys are particularly valuable as they work at the kernel level and can help safely reboot even when the system appears completely unresponsive.
