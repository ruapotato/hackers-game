# zeldaMash

Video was generated by a neural network trained on images of fire - still needs a lot of work.

This project combines two neural network experiments:

The visuals were created using Google's DeepDream algorithm, trained on images of fire to create surreal, dream-like imagery.

The music was generated by a recurrent neural network trained on 15 Zelda songs, creating an AI-composed soundtrack that captures elements of the classic game series.

This was an early experiment in AI-generated multimedia content.
