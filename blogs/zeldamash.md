# zeldaMash

Video was generated by a neural network trained on images of fire - still needs a lot of work.

This project combines two neural network experiments to create an AI-generated audiovisual experience.

## The Visual Component: DeepDream

The visuals were created using **Google's DeepDream** algorithm. DeepDream works by running an image classification neural network in reverse - instead of identifying what's in an image, it enhances patterns the network "sees," creating surreal, dream-like imagery.

For this project, the network was trained on images of fire, resulting in flame-like patterns appearing throughout the video.

## The Audio Component: Recurrent Neural Network

The music was generated by a **recurrent neural network (RNN)** trained on 15 Zelda songs. RNNs are particularly good at learning sequential data like music, as they can remember context from earlier in a sequence.

The network learned patterns from classic Legend of Zelda compositions and generated new music that captures elements of the game series' iconic sound.

## An Early AI Experiment

This was an early experiment in AI-generated multimedia content, exploring:

- **Generative art** - Using neural networks to create visual art
- **Music generation** - AI composition based on training data
- **Combining modalities** - Merging AI-generated audio and video

While the creator notes it "still needs a lot of work," this project represents the kind of experimentation that eventually led to today's more sophisticated AI art and music generation tools.
