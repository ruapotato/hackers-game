# Librem5 | Emulation + Audiobook player

Testing out some emulators and building an audiobook player.

This video covers two exciting projects on the Librem 5: running emulators for retro gaming and developing Phonic, a custom audiobook player application built with GTK.

## Emulation on the Librem 5

The Librem 5 dev kit demonstrates impressive emulation capabilities. Since it runs a full Linux desktop environment, existing emulators can be compiled and run on the device with minimal modifications.

## Phonic - Audiobook Player

Phonic is a GTK-based audiobook player designed for the Librem 5's mobile interface. The application is designed to work well with touch controls and the phone's form factor.

**Source Code**: https://bitbucket.org/hackersgame/phonic/src/master/

## GTK Development

Building mobile applications for the Librem 5 uses standard GTK development practices. The phone's Phosh shell and libhandy library provide adaptive widgets that work well on both mobile and desktop form factors.
