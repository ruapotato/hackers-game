# Robocalls | Fight Bots with Bots

Let a robot answer your phone for you.

This video demonstrates how to use automation to combat robocalls by having a bot answer your phone and handle unwanted calls automatically. If they're going to use robots to call you, why not use a robot to answer?

## The Solution: Callen

The project featured in this video is called **Callen**, a bot designed to intercept and handle robocalls.

**Source Code:** [Callen on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/hackersgame/callen/)

## How It Works

The system uses:

- **IVR (Interactive Voice Response)** - Automated menu systems to interact with callers
- **Audio processing** - Handling incoming audio from callers
- **VoIP integration** - Working with phone systems
- **Librem 5 integration** - Tested and demonstrated on the Librem 5 Linux phone

## Features

- Automatically answers incoming calls
- Can detect and handle robocalls
- Wastes robocallers' time with automated responses
- Protects your time and attention from spam calls

## Why This Matters

Robocalls have become an epidemic, with billions of spam calls made every year. Traditional blocking methods are reactive - you have to receive the call first before you can block the number. This approach is proactive, letting a bot handle the call so you never have to.

By making robocalling less profitable (wasting their time with bots), we can help reduce the incentive for these spam operations.
