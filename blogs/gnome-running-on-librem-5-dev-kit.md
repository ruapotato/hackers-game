# Gnome running on the Librem 5 Dev Kit

Testing different desktop environments on the dev kit.

This video demonstrates running the GNOME desktop environment on the Librem 5 development kit, showcasing the progress of bringing full desktop Linux experiences to mobile devices.

## What This Demonstrates

The Librem 5 dev kit allows testing various desktop environments to evaluate which ones work best for a mobile Linux phone form factor. Running GNOME on the dev kit shows:

- How traditional desktop environments can be adapted for mobile use
- The state of GNOME's touch-friendly features on the Librem 5 hardware
- Early development progress toward a fully functional Linux smartphone

The Librem 5 dev kit was instrumental in testing and developing the software stack that would eventually run on the production Librem 5 phones.
