# Python | Codecademy walkthrough E02

Going over the basics of python again.

This is episode 2 of the Codecademy walkthrough series, continuing our exploration of Python fundamentals.

## Topics Covered in This Episode

- **Modifying Variables** - Learn how to update and change variable values after they've been assigned. This includes reassignment, incrementing/decrementing, and compound assignment operators.

- **Integer Division** - Understanding the difference between regular division and integer (floor) division in Python. In Python 3, the `//` operator performs integer division, while `/` performs true division.

- **Multiline Strings** - How to create strings that span multiple lines using triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`). This is useful for documentation strings (docstrings), formatted text output, and storing longer text content.

## Building on Episode 1

This episode builds directly on the concepts from Episode 1, showing how variables can be manipulated and how Python handles different types of data operations. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial before moving on to more complex topics like control flow and functions.
