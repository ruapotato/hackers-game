# Godot vs Armory3d vs UPBGE

Just what is the best Open Source Game engine, let's find out!

This video compares three popular open source game engines: Godot, Armory3d, and UPBGE (Uchronia Project Blender Game Engine). Each engine has its own strengths and use cases for game development.

The comparison includes practical examples using the Balder3d project implemented in each engine, as well as the Griselda space game project. This hands-on approach demonstrates the real-world differences between these game development platforms.
