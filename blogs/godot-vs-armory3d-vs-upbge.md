# Godot vs Armory3d vs UPBGE

Just what is the best Open Source Game engine, let's find out!

This video compares three popular open source game engines: Godot, Armory3d, and UPBGE (Uchronia Project Blender Game Engine). Each engine has its own strengths and use cases for game development.

## Comparison Projects

The comparison includes practical examples using real game projects implemented in each engine:

### Balder3d Project
A game project implemented across all three engines to demonstrate the differences:
- **Armory3d version**: [Balder3d for ArmSDK](https://bitbucket.org/hackersgame/balder3d_armsdk/src/master/)
- **UPBGE version**: [Balder3d for UPBGE](https://bitbucket.org/hackersgame/balder3d_upbge/src/master/)
- **Godot version**: [Balder3d for Godot](https://bitbucket.org/hackersgame/balder3d/src/master/)

### Griselda Space Game
A space game project used to demonstrate game development capabilities: [Griselda](https://bitbucket.org/hackersgame/griselda/src/master/)

## Engine Overview

- **Godot**: A fully-featured, community-driven game engine with its own scripting language (GDScript) and support for multiple platforms
- **Armory3d**: A game engine integrated directly into Blender, allowing 3D artists to create games within their familiar environment
- **UPBGE**: The Uchronia Project Blender Game Engine, a fork of the original Blender Game Engine with continued development and improvements

This hands-on approach demonstrates the real-world differences between these game development platforms, helping developers choose the right tool for their projects.
