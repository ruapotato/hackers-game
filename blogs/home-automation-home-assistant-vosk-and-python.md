# Home Automation: Home Assistant, VOSK, and Python

This video covers integrating Home Assistant with VOSK voice recognition using Python. The Home Butler project demonstrates how to build a local voice-controlled home automation system without relying on cloud services.

## Project Overview

The Home Butler project provides a privacy-focused approach to voice-controlled home automation by keeping all speech recognition processing local on your own hardware.

## Key Technologies

### Home Assistant
An open-source home automation platform that runs on various devices and supports thousands of smart home devices and services.

### VOSK
An offline speech recognition toolkit that provides accurate voice recognition without sending your data to cloud services. Perfect for privacy-conscious users who want voice control without surveillance.

### Python Integration
Python serves as the glue connecting VOSK's speech recognition to Home Assistant's automation capabilities, allowing voice commands to control your smart home devices.
