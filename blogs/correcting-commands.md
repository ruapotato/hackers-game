# Correcting Commands

Fixing typos in Bash. This video covers useful techniques for correcting command-line errors and typos, making your terminal workflow more efficient.

## Techniques Covered

Learn how to quickly fix mistakes without retyping entire commands using:

- **Readline shortcuts** - Built-in keyboard shortcuts for editing commands
- **History substitution** - Rerun and modify previous commands
- **Quick corrections** - Fast ways to fix common typos
- **Argument manipulation** - Working with command arguments efficiently

## Key Readline Shortcuts

The video demonstrates essential readline features that work in Bash and many other shells:

- Navigation shortcuts (move by word, jump to start/end)
- Deletion shortcuts (delete word, clear line)
- History navigation and search
- Text manipulation commands

## Why This Matters

Efficient command-line correction saves time and reduces frustration:

- No need to retype long commands for small errors
- Faster iteration when experimenting with commands
- More productive terminal sessions
- Works across Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like systems

These techniques become second nature with practice and significantly speed up command-line work.
