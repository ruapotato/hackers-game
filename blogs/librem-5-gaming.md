# Librem 5 | Gaming

Let's take a look at what runs on the Librem 5 Birch batch.

Sebastian, one of the developers at Purism, explored gaming capabilities on the Librem 5 Birch edition. This video showcases various open-source games running on the device.

## Credit Where Due

All credit for this goes to Sebastian. It is truly amazing what an experienced developer can do in such a short amount of time.

## Warning

Do note: applying some of these tweaks have side effects. It is good practice to have a valid backup, and it's not a bad idea to check out the steps to reflash the phone if something does go wrong.

If you're not feeling that adventurous, don't worry - just watching is fine!

## Games That Work

Several open-source games have been tested on the Librem 5:
- Classic 2D games work well
- Some 3D games run with tweaks
- Touch controls need adaptation for games designed for keyboard/mouse input

## The Birch Batch

The Birch batch was an early production run of the Librem 5, following the dev kit and Aspen batches. It featured hardware improvements but was still considered a developer-focused release as the software continued to mature.

## The Takeaway

Gaming on a Linux phone is possible! It's not going to replace your Switch, but for casual open-source games, it's actually pretty decent. The full Linux environment means any game that can be compiled for ARM and uses compatible graphics APIs has the potential to run.
