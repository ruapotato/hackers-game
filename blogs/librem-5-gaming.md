# Librem 5 | Gaming

Sebastian, one of the badass devs over at Purism, messed around with some common open-source games on the Librem 5. Let's check out what he got running and go over some of the useful tweaks he used.

## Credit Where Due

All credit for this goes to Sebastian. It is truly amazing what an experienced developer can do in such a short amount of time.

## Warning

Do note: applying some of these tweaks have side effects. It is good practice to have a valid backup, and it's not a bad idea to check out the steps to reflash the phone if something does go wrong.

If you're not feeling that adventurous, don't worry - just watching is fine!

## Games That Work

Several open-source games have been tested:
- Classic 2D games work well
- Some 3D games run with tweaks
- Touch controls need adaptation

## The Takeaway

Gaming on a Linux phone is possible! It's not going to replace your Switch, but for casual open-source games, it's actually pretty decent.
