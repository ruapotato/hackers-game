# Librem 5 Screen Reader

Read and copy any text from any app on the Librem 5.

This video demonstrates a screen reader application for the Librem 5 that allows users to read and copy text from any application on the device.

## The Readit Application

Readit is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool that captures screen content and extracts text. This enables accessibility features and text extraction from applications that don't natively support text selection.

**Source Code**: https://source.puri.sm/david.hamner/readit

### Features

- **Screen capture**: Takes a screenshot of the current screen
- **OCR processing**: Uses optical character recognition to identify text
- **Text extraction**: Converts image text to selectable, copyable text
- **Universal compatibility**: Works with any application's display

### Use Cases

- Extract text from images or PDFs
- Copy text from applications without copy/paste support
- Accessibility for users who need text-to-speech
- Quick note-taking from any screen content

## How It Works

1. Activate Readit through the app or a keyboard shortcut
2. The current screen is captured
3. OCR engine processes the image
4. Recognized text is presented for selection and copying

## Accessibility on Linux Phones

The Librem 5's open platform enables custom accessibility solutions like Readit. Unlike locked-down mobile operating systems, developers can create deep system integrations to assist users with different needs.
