# Librem 5 Screen Reader

Read and copy any text from any app on the Librem 5.

This video demonstrates a screen reader application for the Librem 5 that allows users to read and copy text from any application on the device.

The tool enhances accessibility and usability of the Librem 5, making it easier to extract and work with text content across different apps.

The source code for this application (called "readit") is available for those who want to explore or contribute to the project.
