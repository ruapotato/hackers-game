# Neural Network Trained on Campfire Audio

This video demonstrates using TensorFlow WaveNet to train a neural network on campfire audio samples. The model learns the patterns and characteristics of campfire sounds and can generate new audio based on what it learned.

The project uses the tensorflow-wavenet implementation to train on audio samples and produce synthesized campfire sounds.
