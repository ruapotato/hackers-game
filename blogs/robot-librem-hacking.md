# Robot and Librem 5 Hacking

Screen-capture, keyboard input, and a hacky way to install stuff. Stick around to the end to hear about the robot I'm working on!

## Keyboard Input Options

### On-Screen Keyboard

Out of the box, the Librem 5 has an on-screen keyboard that looks and feels good. You do have the option to switch out the default for some alternatives.

At the moment, the default keyboard alternative is the only one I know about. The default is a bit better-looking though.

### Bluetooth Keyboard

Bluetooth is also a good option to connect a keyboard. Using this mini keyboard/mouse thing, I'm able to enter text in X11 windows as well as native Wayland windows.

## Screen Capture

The video covers methods for capturing the screen on the Librem 5, which is useful for creating tutorials, debugging, and sharing what you're working on.

## Installing Apps

A "hacky" method for installing applications is demonstrated, along with information about Community Apps available for the Librem 5.

## The Robot Project

The video also covers a robotics project that integrates with the Librem 5. The phone's GPIO and USB capabilities make it an interesting platform for hardware hacking.

**Project Resources:**
- **X86 Code:** [CatToy on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/hackersgame/cattoy/)
- **Raspberry Pi Code:** [Laser Control Module](https://bitbucket.org/hackersgame/laser-control-module/)

The robot project uses Python and integrates with the Raspberry Pi for hardware control, demonstrating how GNU/Linux phones can be used as controllers or interfaces for robotics projects.
