# Robot and Librem 5 Hacking

Screen-capture, keyboard input, and a hacky way to install stuff. Stick around to the end to hear about the robot I'm working on!

## On-Screen Keyboard

Out of the box, the Librem 5 has an on-screen keyboard that looks and feels good. You do have the option to switch out the default for some alternatives.

At the moment, the default keyboard alternative is the only one I know about. The default is a bit better-looking though.

## Bluetooth Keyboard

Bluetooth is also a good option to connect a keyboard. Using this mini keyboard/mouse thing, I'm able to enter text in X11 windows as well as native Wayland windows.

## The Robot Project

I've been working on a robotics project that integrates with the Librem 5. The phone's GPIO and USB capabilities make it an interesting platform for hardware hacking.
