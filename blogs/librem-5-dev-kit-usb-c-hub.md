# Librem 5 Dev Kit | USB-C Hub

Playing with the Librem 5 dev kit and exploring USB-C hub connectivity.

This video showcases early development hardware for the Librem 5 Linux phone, specifically testing USB-C hub functionality.

## USB-C Hub Testing

The video demonstrates connecting a USB-C hub to the Librem 5 development kit:

- Hub detection and initialization
- Connected peripheral recognition
- Power delivery through the hub
- Data transfer capabilities

## Why USB-C Matters

USB-C connectivity is crucial for a modern Linux phone:

- **Convergence**: Connect to external displays for desktop mode
- **Peripherals**: Use keyboards, mice, and storage devices
- **Charging**: Fast charging and power delivery
- **Docking**: Full desktop experience with a single cable

## Development Kit I/O

The Librem 5 dev kit allowed testing of:

- USB-C alternate modes (DisplayPort, etc.)
- USB hub functionality
- Power delivery negotiation
- Driver compatibility with various peripherals

## Convergence Vision

One of the Librem 5's key features is convergence - the ability to use the phone as a full desktop computer when connected to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Testing USB-C hub functionality on the dev kit was essential for validating this vision.

This early testing helped ensure that USB-C hub support would work reliably on the production Librem 5 phones.
