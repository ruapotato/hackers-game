# Mobile IP-native Communication

Use cellular data or Wifi at home to call or text.

## The Concept

IP-native communication allows you to make calls and send texts over data connections rather than traditional cellular voice services. This works whether you're on cellular data or connected to WiFi at home.

## Why IP-Native?

### Advantages
- **Flexibility**: Call from anywhere with internet
- **Cost Savings**: Use WiFi at home instead of cellular minutes
- **Privacy**: Your calls don't go through traditional telco infrastructure
- **Linux Phone Friendly**: Better integration with open-source stacks

### How It Works
1. Voice calls are converted to VoIP (Voice over IP)
2. Text messages go through XMPP or similar protocols
3. A service bridges to the regular phone network
4. You get a real phone number others can call/text

## JMP.chat

JMP is highlighted as a solution for IP-native communication:
- Provides a real phone number
- Bridges calls and texts to/from the regular network
- Works great with Linux phones
- Uses open protocols (XMPP/SIP)

## T-Mobile Data-Only Plan

For those who want to go fully IP-native:
- T-Mobile offers data-only prepaid plans
- Use data for all communication via JMP or similar
- No traditional voice/SMS plan needed

## Setup on Linux Phones

Works particularly well on:
- Librem 5
- PinePhone
- Any Linux phone with XMPP/SIP clients
