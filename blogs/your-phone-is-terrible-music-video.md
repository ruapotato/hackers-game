# Your Phone is Terrible | Music Video

Something a bit different. Here is a song I wrote about phones in 2025.

**Lyrics:**

[Intro]
Digital freedom's calling, can you hear it?

[Verse 1]
Got a phone that's locked down tight
They say it's for our own delight
But when I try to code at night
All my dreams just take flight

[Pre-Chorus]
They're selling all our data for some gold
Our stories bought and packaged, then they're sold
They say we're just predictable, they say we fit their mold
But honey, that ain't the future I want to hold

[Chorus]
Break free from these walled gardens
(Time to break away)
Write code without their pardons
(Let's code our way)
Python, Rust, or whatever we choose
These are our dreams, we refuse to lose

[Verse 2]
Want to build a kernel new?
They say that's something we can't do
But freedom's what we're fighting for
So let's kick down every door

[Chorus]
Break free from these walled gardens
(Time to break away)
Write code without their pardons
(Let's code our way)
Python, Rust, or whatever we choose
These are our dreams, we refuse to lose

[Bridge]
I'm not asking for the stars
Just the freedom to go far
Let us write our own story
In our own territory

[Chorus - Final]
Break free from these walled gardens
(Time to break away)
Write code without their pardons
(Let's code our way)
This is our digital revolution
Time to find our own solution
'Cause these are our dreams
And we refuse to lose

[Outro]
The code is ours to write
The future's looking bright
