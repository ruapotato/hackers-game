Let's check out what he got running and go over some of the useful tweaks he used.\n\n## Credit Where Due\n\nAll credit for this goes to Sebastian. It is truly amazing what an experienced developer can do in such a short amount of time.\n\n## Warning\n\nDo note: applying some of these tweaks have side effects. It is good practice to have a valid backup, and it's not a bad idea to check out the steps to reflash the phone if something does go wrong.\n\nIf you're not feeling that adventurous, don't worry - just watching is fine!\n\n## Games That Work\n\nSeveral open-source games have been tested:\n- Classic 2D games work well\n- Some 3D games run with tweaks\n- Touch controls need adaptation\n\n## The Takeaway\n\nGaming on a Linux phone is possible! It's not going to replace your Switch, but for casual open-source games, it's actually pretty decent.\n\n📺 [Watch on YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=a1ENmWmwE8k)"

The default is a bit better-looking though.\n\n## Bluetooth Keyboard\n\nBluetooth is also a good option to connect a keyboard.

For example, on the lockscreen when you enter your PIN code, the key presses remain highlighted - a bit of a security fail.\n\nWe can also see the unfinished app lineup including GNOME Tweaks, Vim, and non-final icons.\n\n## Browser Performance\n\nIf you recall in my last video, the web browser performance is basically unusable in certain situations. Heavy JavaScript sites bring the device to its knees.\n\n## The Verdict\n\nIs it ready? Not quite for daily driver use, but the progress is undeniable.
