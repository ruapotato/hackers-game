Let's take a look.\n\nWhat's in the Box:\n- The phone itself\n- Some cute stickers\n- Glass screen protector\n- A case\n- Free USB-C headphones\n\nFirst Impressions:\nQuick note on the screen protector - it's glass. Mine cracked in shipping. I'd love to see a film screen protector option instead.\n\nLet me save you some confusion: On day one, I thought the side button was the power button. Turns out there are hardware kill switches!\n\nThe Good:\n- Actually works as a phone\n- Hardware kill switches for privacy\n- Real Linux - not Android\n- Good build quality"

      "content": "Progress on the dev kit has been absolutely crazy at the moment. September 15th was the last time I had to flash the dev kit - just nine days before the initial launch of the Librem 5.\n\nAfter flashing, it was clear that this version was not ready for the public. For example, on the lockscreen when you enter your PIN code, the key presses remain highlighted - a bit of a security fail.\n\nIs it ready? Not quite for daily driver use, but the progress is undeniable. The foundation is solid, and things are improving rapidly."

Let's check out what he got running.\n\nSeveral open-source games have been tested:\n- Classic 2D games work well\n- Some 3D games run with tweaks\n- Touch controls need adaptation\n\nGaming on a Linux phone is possible! It's not going to replace your Switch, but for casual open-source games, it's actually pretty decent."

      "content": "Screen-capture, keyboard input, and a hacky way to install stuff. Stick around to the end to hear about the robot I'm working on!\n\nOut of the box, the Librem 5 has an on-screen keyboard that looks and feels good. Bluetooth is also a good option to connect a keyboard.\n\nI've been working on a robotics project that integrates with the Librem 5. The phone's GPIO and USB capabilities make it an interesting platform for hardware hacking."

Your voice commands stay on your local network. No Amazon, no Google, no privacy concerns.\n\n\"Computer, lights on\" actually works now. Living the dream."

Apps want access to everything. But what if we could sandbox untrusted apps in containers?\n\nUnlike Docker, systemd-nspawn is built into systemd - which the Librem 5 already uses. It's lightweight and perfect for this use case.\n\nUse cases:\n- Run untrusted apps without access to your contacts/photos\n- Test software in isolation\n- Keep work and personal data separated"

Time to make my own.\n\nThe Process:\n1. Measure - Calipers are your friend\n2. Design - OpenSCAD for parametric modeling\n3. Print - TPU for flexibility\n4. Iterate - First print is never perfect\n\nTook 3 iterations to get the fit right. The final version has cutouts for all ports, kill switch access, and camera bump accommodation."
